- The program reads file text.txt and creates new files to store words and urls from the text.

| File created        | Description                                                      |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| word_counts.txt     | List of every word that repeated itself more than once + counter |
| cross_reference.txt | Cross reference of every word                                    |
| urls.txt            | List of URLs from the text + counter if needed                   |
